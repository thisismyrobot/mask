# Face mask

My face mask pattern.

## Attribution

This mask is a minor modification of a [pattern
(pdf)](https://daisymultifacetica.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/adult-large-2.pdf)
by [Daisy Multifacetica](https://daisymultifacetica.com/freebies/). The
modification I made is to make a little more room around the nose at the top
of the curve then pull it in a little tighter where it is at its highest.

The instructions are hers too, [available on
YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJmZFPY-4h8).

I take no credit for my pattern, it is simply a modification of hers to suit
me.
